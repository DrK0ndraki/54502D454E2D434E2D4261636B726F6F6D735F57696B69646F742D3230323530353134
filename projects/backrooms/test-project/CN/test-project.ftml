+ **Description**
While it used to be a dungeon, we got it all cleaned up. Even got mattresses in there! The, uh, mattresses might be a little cold from the stone slab they're on, but that's why we added blankets! We managed to make a makeshift fireplaces that use [[[object-15|Firesalt]]], and we put carpet down to stop your feet from freezing from touching the cold stone floor. Even managed to get some posters to decorate the walls! We recommend not touching the walls; they're... cold... and... //stained//... Tried to put some wallpaper and wood up over them but they just appeared on that too. Posters were the only thing that worked to cover up the, uh, //stains.// Uh, anyways, we also crafted some makeshift bathrooms with compost toilets! No running water, though. Anyways, we welcome you to stay in the Comfy Cellar, the perfect apartment home in the backrooms!
[[footnote]]Each apartment fits 1 person each.[[/footnote]]

+ **Apartments A, B, and C**
While nobody's living in it right now, YOU could be the first to live here! It's perfectly safe and comfy... //Please just give us a chance.//

//Please...?//

**Apartment A:**
This cozy place, although the smallest apartment, is the warmest and least... //stained// room here! We filled in the space between the bars of the cell- I mean apartment- with wool and concrete to keep the heat in. It's even the only lodgings with a sink! Couldn't make it work, so we turned it into a nightstand instead! For those not minding a small space, this is the apartment for you!

**Apartment B:**
The largest place in here, it's spacious, and we even managed to get the shackles off the wall! Couldn't get the... //stains//... But we covered the walls with posters, and we'll replace those posters with ones you like for FREE! That's a deal, now ain't it? And this room didn't have bars but instead an iron wall, which we ALSO covered with posters! Everyone loves posters! Ahem, anyways, for those looking for a large space to put your stuff, this is the apartment for you!

**Apartment C:**
This medium-sized place is perfect for those not wanting the small size of Apartment A but not a fan of the posters in Apartment B. It's... a bit cold. Well, more like very cold. The walls seem to suck in heat from our awesome fireplaces that use [[[object-15|Firesalt]]], so we had to put extra blankets for you and carpets on the walls. But for those willing to brave a chill, this might be the perfect room for you!

+ **Entrances and Exits**

++++ Entrances

No-clipping into a locked door in [[[Level 28]]] will send you to your new apartment! Also, no-clipping into a new painting we made and hung in [[[Level 5]]] will also send you here.

++++ Exits

If you ever need to leave to get supplies, just no-clip through the door at the end of the hallway that leads to your new apartment to exit to [[[Level 5]]]. And if you plan on leaving permanently, well... we tried. Hopefully the next person likes the place more than you do!

> **The first one of our tenants agreed to let us record them checking out the place, and the transcript is below.**
> "Well, this place is... dungeon-y. But I have high hopes for my new room! From your description of the apartments, I think I'll pick Apartment A. Small and cozy, just my type of place."
> **They open the door to their new apartment!**
> "Ooh! I love the carpet, and that fireplace that uses [[[object-15|Firesalt]]] you've made is creative! I LOVE the cute nightstand! You said you made the toilet yourselves? Good work! and //THANK YOU.// I was sick and tired of only //sometimes// being transported to [[[Level 189]]]. What? It's a compost toilet? You'll clean it out every week? Awesome! I don't mind compost toilets; I had one back [[[https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms|home]]]. Anyways, it's a bit small and cramped, but nice and cozy. I'll take it!"
> **They put their belongings down in their new room.**
> "This place is nice! I'll enjoy living here."
------
> **The second person who looked at our apartments agreed to let us record them too. Here's the transcript...**
> "This place looks like a prison... Why would I want to live here?"
> **They open the door to apartment B.**
> "Why are there so many posters...? I mean, it's spacious, but what is that stuff behind the posters...?"
> **They lift one of the posters to find one of the... //stains//...**
> "Eugh, is that... BLOOD??? What IS this place?! I don't care how big it is; this is disgusting. Get me out of here."
> **We urge them to please check out the other room first.**
> "No, no, NO. I will not be in this disgusting, freezing place any longer!"
> **They run out of the room and no-clip through the door out of the level.**
------
> **The last tenant that we had also agreed to a recording. Here's the transcript!**
> "Hmm, dungeon-like. I won't judge the room until I see it, though. Apartment C, correct?
> **They open the door to their new room in apartment C!**
> "Brr, it's colder in here. At least there's some [[[object-15|Firesalt]]] in here to warm the place up..."
> **They look around and take some time to think.**
> "... I think I'll take it. I can use this room for storage; I have some things back at [[[Level 11]]] I need to put somewhere."
> "Thanks for the room."
