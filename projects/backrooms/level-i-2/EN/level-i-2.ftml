23/12/2018

I finally came back to Naples; the trip sucked the life out of me. I almost fell over two hours ago due to weariness. Now, at least I'm at the station in Torre del Greco to return home, but it's getting hella late.

I miss Carla and the kids a lot. My phone’s dead, so I can't text them, but I can let time pass by writing in Carla's gifted notebook.

It won't take long; if the train is on time, I'll arrive in an hour, I hope.

But for now I wait; maybe I can continue to write while I'm on the train. Carla said it’s good to write your own thoughts, so I should at least give it a try.

Hah, It seems like I'm writing down a diary. Well, surely it doesn’t hurt; it's a bit embarrassing and funny at the same time.

Here comes the train, late as always.

The train finally arrived, but hell, we're like 60 inside here. There's a woman with a baby near me. She's a girl, so cute.

She reminds me of the time when Carla gave birth to Luisa; she had such a hairy head. Even as a child she looked like a lion! Haha!

Teresa instead was almost bald, so we called her "gummy ball" thanks to that. They were both such beautiful kids.

Now they are going to elementary school. They're growing up so fast; this worries me a little bit, but maybe I can write about this later.

It's very dark outside. I fortunately managed to get on one of the last trains, or I would have had to get on a bus or go by foot, and that wouldn't have been ideal.

It's warm here, at least, while outside is freezing cold. December freezes me up every time.

We already passed a few stops, and we should go under a tunnel if I remember correctly.

I wonder if the kids are sleeping, if Carla is waiting for me...

I don't want her to stay up till this hour; it's late, and she's probably tired.

She worries so much about me, and I'd like her to relax a bit. Tomorrow we will all go together to watch a Christmas movie; I've made my decision!

I'd prefer not to disturb the other passengers, so I won't talk to anybody; it would be too embarrassing. I'm terribly bored, though.

Well, it won't take long, and then when I get back home I'll get to sleep; I'm too tired to eat something.

My hand hurts, so I'll stop writing for a bit. We are about to go through the tunnel; I hate tight spaces, so I'll try to not look out.

I'll get home in a bit; that's what I need to remind myself.

Don't be afraid; you aren't a kid anymore, Francesco.

There's something wrong...

The train is going too fast.

I'm not seeing any stars outside anymore.

I'm not seeing anything.

I can't understand what's happening; it's scary.

We are falling.

The train is falling.

Carla, Luisa, Teresa.

I'm not about to die, right?

I must return home.

Home.

+ **Description**
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
**Level I-2** is made of a large number of train stations. Each stop is modeled as a rectangular block, but their sizes may vary by unknown means. There have been reports of stops traceable back to cities, countrysides, snowy mountains, and inside a long tunnel. Every one of them similar to the reality outside of the Backrooms, but never exactly the same. The stops are always described as if a camera had taken an imperfect picture.

Every stop is completely random, meaning that every time the train starts its journey in the level, the stops will be different. This has been confirmed by other pictures taken by wanderers, which don't match with the one taken by Francesco.

The level has, in fact, a single train without a name or initials, which passes through every stop of that trip and stops only at the entrance. The train never comes back to the first stop until every passenger has been dropped off, and this also works if the passengers die, as their corpses will decompose very fast during the returning trip. When the train comes back to the first stop, there won't be any trace left of the dead travelers of the previous trip, but their objects will remain intact but will look old and covered in dust. No skeleton has been found, suggesting that the train's acceleration increases so much that the bones break down and dissolve, erasing all proof of the bodies.

Inside the level, time goes very fast. While the train comes back to the first stop, the amount of time that passes is uncertain, but it can be theorised that a period of 50 years passes. Everything happens only while the train comes back, when there aren't any passengers left.

The insides of the train may vary depending on the trip, changing into any Frontrooms train due to unspecified reasons, usually similar to the ones found in Japan. Only one picture of the insides has been found. A major part of the train can contain up to 100 people in total, but cases of bigger numbers have been recorded.

It is impossible to find either food or water inside the level, making it even more dangerous.
Anyone who can't get out by no-clipping will die of starvation. No one ever managed to survive, according to the reports, as the trip will continue until there are no more passengers. No exits have been found, and it's highly advised to not stay too long inside the level.

According to Francesco's works, during the outward journey, the path will elongate itself to make the passengers exhausted and near-death by the time they arrive so they can then die faster. As he describes, the train goes through the same looped path for a while until all the passengers either get out or die. The travellers outside will die if they don't manage to get out of the level.
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
+ **Origins Of The Level**

The level's creation happened on 23/12/2018 as a train going to Naples from Italy no-clipped into the ground, forming the level as it reached the Backrooms. The only sources of information from that day are found inside an old diary written by a man named Francesco, who, together with 60 other travelers, found himself inside the Backrooms and decided to write every relevant moment until his own death. No passenger has survived. Every passenger's object has been taken into custody by the M.E.G. together with Francesco's diary.

To this day, the rough number of people that died on the level stands at 350, as more than 5 trains coming from the Frontrooms no-clipped into the Backrooms. While these are the only ones confirmed by evidence, there could be many others, as there is no way to avoid these tragedies.

Following are attached excerpts of Francesco's diary as a way to demonstrate evidence.

[[div class="styled-quote"]]

The train fell through the tracks. The sky is dark. I don't know where we are. Everyone's panicking.

I think I passed out for 10 minutes, and the train is starting again. I don't know where, but everything I see out of the window doesn't make sense.

Cities mixed with mountains and countrysides... And a pitch-black sky...

The woman near me is trying to calm her daughter; there was an angry man before that shouting at her.

We need to remain calm and try to get home; maybe we just need to reach the last stop.

I'll arrive just a bit late, Carla… I'll come back soon.

When we arrive at the next stop, I'll try to write what we decided to do.

Someone suggested trying to wait for another train to come back, as there are monitors showing timetables. But I want to stay here, just in case we arrive too late...

Everything will go well; whatever happened can be fixed. We found a way to talk with the conductor, but he didn't respond...

I'm afraid, but I need to keep it together.

[[/div]]
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
[[div class="styled-quote"]]

The stops are very small, so only 15 people got off the train. We've decided to split all the volunteers who want to get off the train into groups; everyone will get off stop by stop. The woman near me decided to stay; her name's Chiara.

I tried reassuring her; in any case, the train can't go infinitely on, and I'm sure that after a certain number of stops we'll get home.

What worries me is that there isn't any distributor at the stops. I hope the return train won't take too long to arrive...

I'm a bit hungry, but I'll be well. I'm going to eat at home, if I must.

There are a lot of stops, all without a name. All the signs are completely empty, and that confuses me. I hope that anywhere we are now isn't a desolated place.

A woman mumbled that we are in Purgatory. I doubt that if Purgatory existed, it would be on a train, but I must say that everything seems unreal here. Everything feels distorted and strange.

Who knows if we are really in Purgatory or in another dimension like science-fiction films? I really hope we are not.

Carla... Don't worry about me; it's just an incident, maybe also a nightmare.

It could be that I'll wake up next to you in a few minutes, and we'll laugh at this stupid nightmare... And then everything will go well.

Just a stupid nightmare...

I don't have fear...

[[/div]]

[[div class="styled-quote"]]

Multiple hours have passed; other people got down at the stops. We are tired, and we are hungry. We are halfway there, but everything will go well. Chiara says she’s very tired, so I tried to care for her baby while she slept. She has just been breastfed, so she seems well, so she's less hungry than us.

The passengers don't seem to be very happy as the baby is crying a lot; they all seem very irritated. Some are eating their nails out of hunger; I don't know how much we can resist without food or water. I'm starting to think that not only hours have passed but even days, which is completely stupid. I am just paranoid, right?

I haven't seen any train come back yet, and I'm starting to worry. I'm having the sensation that it will not end well. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but I am really, really scared.

I need to be strong for my daughters, for my Carla. There must be a way to come back home, but there are no exits...

I'm hungry.

[[/div]]
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
[[div class="styled-quote"]]

The baby isn't crying anymore, and Chiara isn't waking up either.

I don't know what to do.

They're hungry.

They're shouting and punching the walls of the train.

I'm hungry, very hungry, and thirsty. I feel tired; I can't even write well.

Some aren't even moving anymore.

How far is it?

Only two stops.

I can’t take it anymore.

I want to go home; I want to get home to my daughters…

I don't want to die; why now? Why?

Carla...

Please God, don't make me die; let me get home; my wife and my daughters need me.

Please.

It's like the train is taking longer with the intention of letting us die.

This is not Purgatory; this is Hell, and we're dying inside of it.

What have I done to deserve all of this?

I do not understand.

I want to go home.

[[/div]]
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
[[div class="styled-quote"]]

Everyone's on the ground; I don't know who's alive and who's not.

I won't resist until the last stop; there's no exit.

It's a joke, a terrible joke. Death was our destiny from the start.

It's all my fault.

I'm so sorry...

Luisa... Teresa... Your dad will never come back.

I don't want to die... I want to come back home to my wife... To my daughters... We had to pass Christmas together...

I can’t move my legs anymore.

I'm tired.

I'm sorry.

I love you; dad loves you.

I love you, Carla. I love you so much.

Forgive me; forgive me for not being strong enough.

Now I... must sleep.

I can’t stay awake...

If someone finds this diary... Please... Tell my wife and kids that I'm not around anymore.

Please, this is my last request.

Never come to this place.

Because you will die.

Following the birth of the level, the group of M.E.G. agents named "Train Explorers" after finishing their research inside Level I-2 accidentally no-clipped inside the level via a poster of a train inside an M.E.G. base. The group was composed of three members named Mary, Jake, and Ryker.

They were equipped with an exploratory drone and some recorders with some radios to communicate directly to the base, which gave them the ability to share information about the diary, the looks of the level, and the train.

The cameras recorded a process of decomposition and acceleration of the train before discharging. They were then taken by a second M.E.G. group, which managed to come back to the base via no-clipping.

The group "Train Explorers" never came back to the base, and every member has been declared dead. Without them, it wouldn't have been possible to obtain important information and recordings; they will always be remembered for their courage and their sacrifice. All the videos and pictures are stored inside the base.

To this day the number of victims keeps growing, while the M.E.G. is trying to find all the entrances to this level as a means to block any access to it from the Backrooms. As for the Frontrooms entrance, there is no measure possible.
@@@@
@@@@
@@@@
[[div class="styled-quote"]]

+ WARNING

We invite every individual who can find an entrance to this level to contact a base as fast as possible as a means to block it and save many lives.

Do not try to enter the level; there's no secure way to exit. Every exploration is unadvised unless you know how to no-clip.

- M.E.G. Security Supervisor Alfredo Stanzione.

+ **Entrances and Exits**
@@@@
@@@@
++++ Entrances

* The most common way to access the level is by getting on a train that no-clips into the ground, which will make every passenger appear inside of the train of level I-2.

* Other sources state that no-clipping in any train or station inside the Backrooms could take to the level.

* Touching a poster or any object that could belong to or depict a train grants access to the level via no-clip.

* A singular source states having heard the sound of the train before passing out and appearing in the level. This isn't confirmed, yes, but it implies that it is possible to access the level everywhere after hearing the sound.

++++ Exits

* The only confirmed way to get out of the level is no-clipping inside any wall, pavement, or object and then arriving in a random level.
